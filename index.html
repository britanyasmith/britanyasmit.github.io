Iâ€™m a graduate of 2022 from North Carolina State University with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I am an aspiring Robotics Engineer with a passion of making the world a better place one line of code at a time. I believe that the world is moving towards massive growth and development in the robotics field. My passion is to enhance this movement by delving deeper into how these robots can not only impact the environment but each human individually. Imagine the capability at our fingertips to create the next impactful technological development. I find passion in teaching computers/robots how to behave like people whether that is teaching them to see the world the way we do or learn the way we do or better."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/home/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/home/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/home/social-image.png"/><title>Britanya Wright-Smith</title><script defer="defer" src="/home/static/js/main.492e234c.js"></script><link href="/home/static/css/main.778eeed7.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
